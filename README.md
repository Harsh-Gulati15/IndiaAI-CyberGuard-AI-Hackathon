# Crime Category Prediction

## Overview

The **Crime Category Prediction** project aims to classify crime incidents based on the details provided in the crime description. Using machine learning, particularly **Logistic Regression** with **TF-IDF vectorization**, this model predicts the category of the crime based on text data, such as crime descriptions. This project is designed to help law enforcement agencies and analysts identify crime trends, improve public safety strategies, and make data-driven decisions.

### Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess crime data.
- Train a machine learning model to classify crimes into different categories.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for making predictions on new crime descriptions.
